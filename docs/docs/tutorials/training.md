# Basic Training Tutorial

## Objective

Learn how to train a DQN model for intrusion detection from scratch, understand the training process, and evaluate model performance.

## Prerequisites

- RL-IDS system installed and configured
- CICIDS2017 dataset prepared (see [Data Preparation Guide](data_preparation.md))
- Basic understanding of reinforcement learning concepts

## Step 1: Verify Data Preparation

First, ensure your data is properly prepared:

```bash
# Check if processed data exists
ls data/processed/
# Should show: train.csv, val.csv, test.csv

# If not, process the raw data
python -m rl_ids.make_dataset
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üóÇÔ∏è  Starting data loading from directory: data/raw
üìÑ Found 8 CSV files to process
üîó Concatenating data frames...
üßπ Starting data preprocessing...
‚úÖ Data loading and preprocessing complete! Final shape: (2830743, 79)
```

## Step 2: Basic Training

Start with a basic training session using default parameters:

```bash
# Basic training (recommended for first run)
python -m rl_ids.modeling.train \
    --num-episodes 100 \
    --batch-size 128 \
    --save-interval 25
```

**Expected Output:**
```

Episode 25/100: Reward=2341, Accuracy=78.9%, Loss=0.0156, Œµ=0.876
Episode 50/100: Reward=3456, Accuracy=85.2%, Loss=0.0098, Œµ=0.678
Episode 75/100: Reward=4123, Accuracy=89.1%, Loss=0.0067, Œµ=0.543
Episode 100/100: Reward=4567, Accuracy=91.3%, Loss=0.0045, Œµ=0.432

‚úÖ Training completed successfully!
üìä Best model saved to: models/dqn_model_best.pt
üìä Final model saved to: models/dqn_model_final.pt
```

## Step 3: Monitor Training Progress

During training, several files are created to track progress:

### Model Checkpoints
```bash
ls models/
# Output:
# dqn_model_best.pt      - Best performing model
# dqn_model_final.pt     - Final model after all episodes
# episodes/              - Directory with episode checkpoints
#   dqn_model_episode_25.pt
#   dqn_model_episode_50.pt
#   dqn_model_episode_75.pt
#   dqn_model_episode_100.pt
```

### Training Reports
```bash
ls reports/
# Output:
# training_metrics.csv   - Detailed training metrics
```

## Step 4: Evaluate Your Model

After training, evaluate the model performance:

```bash
# Evaluate the best model
python -m rl_ids.modeling.evaluate \
    --test-episodes 10 \
    --use-best-model
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üß™ Starting Enhanced DQN Agent Evaluation
ü§ñ Loading trained model from models/dqn_model_best.pt
üåç Initializing test environment...

Episode 1/10: Accuracy=91.2%, Reward=4532, Steps=2234
Episode 5/10: Accuracy=92.1%, Reward=4651, Steps=2189
Episode 10/10: Accuracy=91.8%, Reward=4598, Steps=2201

üìä Evaluation Results:
  Overall Accuracy: 91.73% ¬± 0.34%
  Average Reward: 4596.3 ¬± 45.2
  Average Steps: 2208.1 ¬± 18.7
  High-Confidence Accuracy: 95.21%

üìà Reports generated in: reports/
üìä Visualizations saved in: reports/figures/
```

## Step 5: View Training Results

Examine the generated reports and visualizations:

### Key Files Generated
```bash
ls reports/
evaluation_summary_enhanced.csv
evaluation_episode_details_enhanced.csv
evaluation_detailed_predictions_enhanced.csv
evaluation_classification_report.csv

ls reports/figures/

## Step 6: Advanced Training Configuration

Once you're comfortable with basic training, try advanced configurations:

```bash

    --num-episodes 500 \
    --lr 1e-4 \
    --batch-size 256 \
    --hidden-dims "1024,512,256,128" \

    --eps-decay 0.9995 \
    --memory-size 200000 \
    --double-dqn \
    --dueling \
    --curriculum-learning \
    --early-stopping-patience 50 \

    --num-episodes 300 \
    --lr 5e-5 \
    --batch-size 128 \
    --models-dir models/conservative \
    --reports-dir reports/conservative

# Experiment 2: Aggressive learning  
python -m rl_ids.modeling.train \
    --num-episodes 300 \
    --lr 1e-3 \
    --batch-size 512 \
    --models-dir models/aggressive \
    --reports-dir reports/aggressive

# Evaluate both models
python -m rl_ids.modeling.evaluate \
    --model-path models/conservative/dqn_model_best.pt \
    --reports-dir reports/conservative_eval

python -m rl_ids.modeling.evaluate \
    --model-path models/aggressive/dqn_model_best.pt \
    --reports-dir reports/aggressive_eval
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. CUDA Out of Memory
```bash
# Reduce batch size
python -m rl_ids.modeling.train --batch-size 64

# Or use CPU only
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""
python -m rl_ids.modeling.train
```

#### 2. Poor Training Performance
```bash
# Check data distribution
python -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/processed/train.csv')
print(df['Label'].value_counts())
"

# If imbalanced, regenerate with balancing
python -m rl_ids.make_dataset --balance-classes
```

#### 3. Training Stuck/Not Improving
```bash
# Try curriculum learning
python -m rl_ids.modeling.train \
    --curriculum-learning \
    --curriculum-stages 3

# Or adjust learning rate
python -m rl_ids.modeling.train \
    --lr 1e-5 \
    --lr-scheduler cosine
```

#### 4. Model Not Saving
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la models/
mkdir -p models episodes

# Verify disk space
df -h
```

### Expected Training Times

| Configuration | Episodes | Estimated Time |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| Basic (CPU) | 100 | 30-60 minutes |
| Basic (GPU) | 100 | 10-20 minutes |
| Advanced (GPU) | 500 | 1-3 hours |
| Full Training (GPU) | 1000 | 3-6 hours |
