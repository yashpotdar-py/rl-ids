# Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ addresses common questions about the RL-IDS (Reinforcement Learning Intrusion Detection System).

## General Questions

### What is RL-IDS?

RL-IDS is a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive intrusion detection system that uses Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms to detect network intrusions in real-time. It combines traditional network monitoring with modern machine learning techniques to provide intelligent threat detection.

### What makes RL-IDS different from traditional IDS?

- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously learns from new data and adapts to evolving threats
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Uses reward-based learning to improve detection accuracy
- **Real-time Processing**: Provides immediate threat detection and response
- **Feature-rich Analysis**: Analyzes 78 different network flow features
- **API Integration**: Easy integration with existing security infrastructure

### What types of attacks can RL-IDS detect?

Based on the CICIDS2017 dataset, RL-IDS can detect:
- **DDoS Attacks**: Distributed Denial of Service
- **Port Scan**: Network reconnaissance activities
- **Web Attacks**: SQL injection, XSS, and other web-based attacks
- **Infiltration**: Advanced persistent threats
- **Brute Force**: Password and authentication attacks
- **Botnet**: Command and control communications

## Installation and Setup

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Python 3.13.0+
- 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- 10GB free disk space
- Network interface with administrative privileges

**Recommended:**
- Multi-core CPU (8+ cores for training)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- Fast SSD storage

### Do I need root/administrator privileges?

For network monitoring features, you need:
- **Linux**: Either root privileges or set capabilities: `sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip $(which python)`
- **Windows**: Run as administrator
- **macOS**: Use `sudo` or configure appropriate permissions

For API-only usage, no special privileges are required.

### Can I run RL-IDS without a pre-trained model?

Yes, but with limitations:
- You can train a new model using the provided training scripts
- Training requires the CICIDS2017 dataset (or similar labeled data)
- Initial training may take several hours depending on hardware
- Pre-trained models provide immediate detection capabilities

## Usage and Configuration

### How do I configure network monitoring?

1. **Identify Network Interface**:
   ```python
   import psutil
   print(list(psutil.net_if_addrs().keys()))
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**:
   ```python
   # In network_monitor.py or configuration file
   INTERFACE = "eth0"  # Replace with your interface
   ```

3. **Set Permissions** (Linux):
   ```bash
   sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip $(which python)
   ```

### How do I integrate RL-IDS with my existing security tools?

**API Integration:**
```python
from api.client import RLIDSClient

client = RLIDSClient("http://localhost:8000")
result = client.predict(network_features)
```

**Webhook Integration:**
- Configure webhooks in your security tools

- Consider distributed deployment for high-traffic environments

### Can RL-IDS scale horizontally?

Yes, through several approaches:

**API Scaling:**
- Deploy multiple API instances behind a load balancer
- Use container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Implement distributed caching (Redis)

**Data Processing:**
- Distribute packet capture across multiple interfaces
- Use message queues for processing pipelines
- Implement microservices architecture

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" errors during network monitoring

**Solution:**
```bash
# Linux - Set capabilities
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip $(which python)

# Or run with sudo (not recommended for production)
sudo python network_monitor.py

# Windows - Run as administrator
# Right-click Command Prompt â†’ "Run as administrator"
```

### "ModuleNotFoundError" when importing rl_ids

**Common Causes:**
1. Virtual environment not activated
2. Package not installed properly
3. Python path issues

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Reinstall package
pip install -e .

# Check installation
python -c "import rl_ids; print('Success')"
```

### High memory usage during training

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce Batch Size:**
   ```python
   # In training configuration
   BATCH_SIZE = 32  # Reduce from default
   ```

2. **Enable Gradient Checkpointing:**
   ```python
   # In model configuration
   USE_CHECKPOINT = True
   ```

3. **Use CPU Training:**
   ```bash
   export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""
   ```

### Model not loading or giving errors

**Check Model File:**
```python
import torch
try:
    model = torch.load("models/dqn_model_best.pt")
    print("Model loaded successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Model loading error: {e}")
```

**Regenerate Model:**
```bash
# Retrain model
python rl_ids/modeling/train.py

# Or download pre-trained model (if available)
python -c "from rl_ids.modeling.train import download_pretrained_model; download_pretrained_model()"
```

### API connection issues

**Check API Status:**
```bash
# Test API connectivity
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check if API is running
ps aux | grep "uvicorn\|python.*api"
```

**Common Solutions:**
1. Ensure API server is running
2. Check firewall settings
3. Verify correct host/port configuration
4. Test with different client (curl, browser)
