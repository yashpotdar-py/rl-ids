## Development History

### Project Inception
The RL-IDS project was initiated to address the need for adaptive intrusion detection systems that can learn and evolve with changing threat landscapes. Traditional signature-based systems often fail to detect novel attacks, while rule-based systems require constant manual updates.

### Technology Choices
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Chosen for its ability to adapt and learn from feedback
- **Deep Q-Networks**: Selected for their proven effectiveness in decision-making tasks
- **CICIDS2017 Dataset**: Used as the standard benchmark for network intrusion detection
- **FastAPI**: Selected for high-performance API development with automatic documentation

### Future Roadmap
- **Enhanced Model Architectures**: Exploration of transformer-based models
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Distributed detection across network segments
- **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving collaborative learning
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Online learning capabilities
- **Extended Protocol Support**: IPv6, QUIC, and emerging protocols
