## Overview

The **RL-IDS Adaptive System** is a cutting-edge Reinforcement Learning-driven Adaptive Intrusion Detection System designed to detect network intrusions using Deep Q-Network (DQN) agents. This system combines advanced machine learning techniques with real-time network traffic analysis to provide adaptive and accurate threat detection.

Built on the CICIDS2017 dataset, the system employs sophisticated DQN algorithms including Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and prioritized experience replay to achieve state-of-the-art performance in network intrusion detection. The system provides both training capabilities and production-ready API services for real-time threat detection.
